# CRUD-App-in-Node.js
Advance Programming course Assignment-1

1. Improving the template/code found here: http://mfikri.com/en/blog/nodejs-mysql-crud
2. I used handlebars as templating engine.
3. mySQL is used for data creation, retrieval, update and delete.
4. MongoDb is used for users authentication. (I used mongoDb and mySQL both to gain experience of both)
